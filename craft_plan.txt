Good. Local + physical + real income changes everything.

This is not a hobby brand.
This is a **local premium creative service business.**

If she wants real income, we design it for:

* Repeat customers
* High-margin packages
* Predictable demand cycles (school year, holidays, birthdays)
* Premium positioning

Not “cute crafts.”

# Positioning Strategy

She is:

> **The Local Creative Partner for Busy Families**

Not Etsy.
Not Pinterest.
Not DIY.

She’s the execution layer between idea and reality.

# Refined Brand Position

## What the Craft

### Creative Projects, Fully Handled.

Subheadline:

> Custom class gifts, parties, and meaningful details — designed and delivered locally by Ali.

CTA:

> Book Your Project
> See Packages

---

# Define the Income Model (Critical)

If this becomes real income, it needs:

### 1️⃣ High-Volume Seasonal Revenue

* Back-to-school
* Teacher appreciation week
* Halloween
* Christmas
* Valentine’s Day
* End-of-year class gifts

These are predictable revenue spikes.

### 2️⃣ Mid-Ticket Recurring Revenue

* Birthday party packages
* Baby showers
* Graduation celebrations

### 3️⃣ High-Ticket Custom Projects

* Fully styled party experiences
* Corporate / school event packages
* Large classroom orders

---

# Suggested Pricing Structure (Don’t Undersell)

If she prices like a hobbyist, she will burn out.

### Classroom Gift Package

$150–$350 depending on size

### Birthday Party Creative Package

$400–$1,200 depending on scope

### Custom Project

$75/hr design + materials markup

Local service allows premium pricing.
Parents pay for time savings.

# Website Structure (Built for Conversion)

## 1. Hero

Headline:

> Creative Moments. Zero Stress.

Sub:

> Ali designs and delivers custom class gifts, party details, and meaningful surprises — so you don’t have to.

Button:

> Start My Project

---

## 2. Who This Is For

* The class parent who just volunteered and now regrets it
* The mom who wants Pinterest-level without Pinterest effort
* The host who wants details handled
* The last-minute gift panicker

Short. Punchy. Relatable.

---

## 3. Services (Clear Buckets)

### Classroom & Teacher Gifts

Fully assembled, labeled, delivered.

### Party Styling & Details

Themes, favors, decor, setup.

### Custom Creative Projects

You bring the idea. I build it.

---

## 4. How It Works

1. Tell me your event
2. Approve the concept
3. Pick up or delivery
4. Look amazing

Simple.

---

# Visual Direction (Important)

The illustration you showed is warm and playful.

If she wants premium income, I’d suggest:

* Keep playful brand name
* But clean, modern website layout
* Neutral backgrounds + pops of color
* Real photography of her work (this matters)

Cartoon alone won’t sell premium pricing.

---

# Operational Reality

To turn this into real income, she needs:

## A Defined Minimum Order

No $40 projects.

## Clear Lead Time

Example: “All classroom orders require 10-day notice.”

## Limited Custom Slots

Scarcity increases value.

---

# Growth Strategy (Local)

1. Partner with 3–5 local schools
2. Network with PTA parents
3. Build referral incentives
4. Get 10 testimonials fast
5. Instagram + local Facebook groups

Local word-of-mouth will be everything.
